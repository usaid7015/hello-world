    <h1>Live and Let Die (novel)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <h5>Live and Let Die</h5>
    <p> is the second novel in <a href="#">Ian Fleming</a>'s <a href="#">James Bond series of stories,</a> which is set
        in London, the United States and
        Jamaica.
        It was first published in the UK by <a href="#">Jonathan Cape </a>on 5 April 1954. Fleming wrote the novel at
        his <a href="#">Goldeneye estate</a>
        in Jamaica before
        his first book, <a href="#">Casino Royale,</a> was published;
        much of the background came from Fleming's travel in the US and knowledge of Jamaica.

        The story centres on Bond's pursuit of "Mr Big", a criminal who has links to the American criminal network,
        the world of <a href="#">voodoo</a> and <a href="#">SMERSH</a>—an arm of the Russian secret service—all of which
        are threats to the West. Bond
        becomes involved in the US through Mr Big's smuggling of 17th-century gold coins from British territories in the
        Caribbean. The novel deals with the themes of the ongoing East-West struggle of the <a href="#">Cold
            War</a>—including British
        and American relations, Britain's position in the world, race relations and the struggle between good and evil.

        As with Casino Royale, Live and Let Die was broadly well received by the critics. The initial print run of 7,500
        copies quickly sold out and a second print run was ordered within the year. US sales, when the novel was
        released there a year later, were much slower. Following a <a href="#">comic strip</a> adaptation in 1958–59 by
        <a href="#">John McLusky</a> in
        the <a href="#">Daily Express</a> the novel was adapted in 1973 as the <a href="#">eighth film</a> in the <a
            href="#">Eon Productions</a> Bond series and the
        first to star <a href="#">Roger Moore</a> as Bond. Major plot elements from the novel were also incorporated
        into the Bond films
        <a href="">For Your Eyes Only</a> in 1981 and <a href="#">Licence to Kill</a> in 1989.</p>

        <p><a href="#">Sir Henry Morgan,</a> whose treasure formed the key to the plot</p>
        <p>The British <a href="#">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="#">James Bond</a> is sent by his superior<a
                href="#">,M,</a> to New York City to investigate "Mr
            Big", real name Buonaparte Ignace Gallia. Bond's target is an agent of the <a href="#">Soviet
                counterintelligence</a>
            organisation <a href="#">SMERSH</a>, and an underworld <a href="#">voodoo</a>leader who is suspected of
            selling 17th-century gold coins in
            order to finance Soviet spy operations in America. These gold coins have been turning up in the <a
                href="#">Harlem</a>
            section of <a href="#">New York City</a> and in Florida and are suspected of being part of a treasure that
            was buried in
            Jamaica by the pirate <a href="#">Henry Morgan.</a>

            In New York, Bond meets up with his counterpart in the <a href="#">CIA, Felix Leiter</a>. The two visit some
            of Mr Big's
            nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling
            employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the
            truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter,
            and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men; Leiter is released
            with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.

            Solitaire later leaves Mr Big and contacts Bond; the couple travel by train to <a href="#">St. Petersburg,
                Florida,</a>
            where they meet Leiter. While Bond and Leiter are scouting one of Mr Big's warehouses used for storing
            exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr Big's minions. Leiter later returns to the warehouse by himself,
            but is either captured and fed to a shark or tricked into standing on a trap door over the shark tank
            through which he falls; he survives, but loses an arm and a leg. Bond finds him in their safe house with a
            note pinned to his chest "He disagreed with something that ate him".<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Bond then
            investigates the warehouse
            himself and discovers that Mr Big is smuggling gold coins by hiding them in the bottom of fish tanks holding
            poisonous tropical fish, which he is bringing into the US. He is attacked in the warehouse by "the Robber",
            Mr Big's gunman, and in the resultant gunfight Bond outwits the Robber and causes him to fall into the shark
            tank.

            Bond continues his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, the
            head of the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in <a href="#">scuba diving</a> in the local
            waters. Bond swims
            through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a <a href="#">limpet
                mine</a> on the
            hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following
            morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow <a
                href="#">coral reef</a>
            and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings
            will eat them.

            Bond and Solitaire are saved when the limpet mine explodes seconds before they are dragged over the reef:
            though temporarily stunned by the explosion and injured on the coral, they are protected from the explosion
            by the reef and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda.
            Quarrel then rescues the couple.</p>
